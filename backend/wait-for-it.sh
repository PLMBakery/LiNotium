2. **If Itâ€™s Missing**:
- If the file is missing, you can create a new file with that name in the backend folder.

To help you, here's a basic version of the `wait-for-it.sh` script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

host="$1"
shift
cmd="$@"

until pg_isready -h "$host"; do
>&2 echo "Postgres is unavailable - sleeping"
sleep 1
done

>&2 echo "Postgres is up - executing command"
exec $cmd
